                    <h1>The Hollow Client</h1>
                    <p>Jack Griffin certainly knew how to make an entrance. We'd been to a suit-fitting for the wedding and
                        when we got back, there he was. Or rather, there he wasn't. Because there, sitting in my chair, was
                        Jack Griffin's suit. Just his suit. Without him in it. He'd emailed us a few days earlier asking
                        for our help. A student at Goldsmiths University, he'd wanted us to investigate what he described
                        as his 'invisibility'. It had started a few weeks before when his flatmate, Alan Flanagan, had bumped
                        into him, claiming that he literally hadn't seen Jack standing there. They both just dismissed it
                        but then it happened again. Alan had gone to sit down in a chair that Jack was already sitting in.
                        And then it happened again and again. He'd told us he'd be arriving that day but we'd been late back
                        because Sherlock had been obsessing about us wearing the right shoes. And then, when we got back,
                        there was his suit. As we stared at the suit, Sherlock quickly formulated a number of solutions.
                        Alan had been winding Jack up to the point where Jack genuinely believed he was invisible. Jack had
                        wrapped himself in a complex set of mirrors so that it appeared as if he was invisible. Or had been
                        wrapped up in the mirrors by Alan. He briefly considered invisible paint. Perhaps Jack and Alan were
                        highly-advanced scientists (they weren't, they were media students). We'd been drugged on the way
                        in and taken to an exact replica of 221B Baker Street where a camera was projecting the suit into
                        the chair. I did stop him at that point and ask who'd have done that. He shrugged and suggested ninjas.
                        Then he continued... the suit was a hologram, Jack had never existed, Jack was dressed up in the
                        same fabric as the chair... At that point I had to stop him and point out that, as students, perhaps
                        Jack and Alan were just winding us up. And that perhaps it was just an empty suit. Sherlock accepted,
                        grudgingly, that I might be right. And when we checked the chair, sure enough it was just an empty
                        suit. He was disappointed. I think he preferred the idea of it being some elaborate plot involving
                        ninjas and a complex set of mirrors. Bet he doesn't talk about that one at the wedding.

                    <h1>The Six Thatchers</h1>
                    <p>I'd taken Sherlock out Christmas shopping which, looking back, wasn't the best of ideas. He'd shouted
                        at a Father Christmas that he was bored and wanted a nice juicy murder for Christmas - in front of
                        a bunch of kids and their parents. Escorted back to the flat by the police, we found a student, Sally
                        Barnicot, waiting for us. After Sherlock had managed to insult her about her looks and the way she
                        was dressed, she told us about a murder that had taken place at her university. Pietro Venucci, an
                        art student, and Sally's best friend had been found stabbed in the pottery room. His boyfriend, Beppo
                        Rovito, was discovered next to the body and told the police that he'd just discovered him. A smashed
                        window seemed to confirm that someone had broken in and as there was no knife on Beppo or in the
                        room, he'd been released from custody. Sally was convinced that Beppo did it as he and Pietro had
                        had a fiery relationship. It didn't take Sherlock Holmes to work out that she'd also been in love
                        with Pietro. Sherlock was instantly on the internet and was thrilled to discover that there had been
                        a number of burglaries at houses belonging to a couple of students, a lecturer and a friend of the
                        victim. He had, of course, already worked it all out. Sherlock requested, or rather ordered, me to
                        go to the university, pretending to be a curator from the Hickman Gallery. I told the art lecturer,
                        Horace Harker, that I was interested in displaying some students' work - especially pieces of sculpture.
                        Naturally, the murder came up in conversation and I asked if the victim had been working on anything
                        in particular as we could display it as a nice tribute to him. Harker said that Pietro had made six
                        pottery figures of Maggie Thatcher before he died. They were like those ones you see of Princess
                        Diana advertised in magazines only they had devil horns. This was satire, apparently. The figures,
                        Harker told me sadly, had already been taken. We went to visit the people who'd been burgled and
                        it turns out that they'd all bought one of the Thatcher figures. Nothing else had been taken during
                        the break-ins which, again, was what Sherlock had expected to hear. We found the addresses of the
                        people who owned the remaining two figures and contacted them. That night, I took one address and
                        Sherlock the other. I sat there, in the dark and waited. Then, hearing the sound of a window breaking,
                        I hid. I watched as Beppo broke in and found the figure on the mantlepiece. I followed him outside
                        and called Sherlock who joined me. We followed him to a bridge and watched as he smashed the figure
                        to the ground. Something was inside it which he picked up, ready to throw in the river. Before he
                        could, we stopped him and found that he was holding a penknife with his initials on it. Knowing that
                        it was all over, he confessed immediately. He and Pietro had had an argument and, in a struggle,
                        Beppo had stabbed him. He'd seen the figures were about to go into the oven and had pushed the knife
                        into the clay. He'd then smashed a window to make it look like there'd been a break-in. I thought
                        that what he'd done was pretty clever but Sherlock described as disappointingly simple. The next
                        day he spent so much time going on about how he'd have got away with it that I went to the pub and
                        left him talking to a frozen turkey. Oh, and he's still getting those texts.

                    <h1>The Speckled Blonde</h1>
                    <p>Early thirties, dyed blonde hair, strange red speckles all over her body. The woman, Julia Stoner, had
                        been found in her bed. There seemed to be no obvious cause of death. Her sister, Helen, said that
                        Julia had been feeling a bit rundown for the last few weeks but had figured she was stressed because
                        she was getting married soon. It was only after performing the autopsy, that I discovered two tiny
                        puncture marks in her right ankle and traces of an unidentified poison in her bloodstream. The obvious
                        answer was that she had been bitten by something, presumably some kind of snake. As I started to
                        phone the local zoos to see if any had recently escaped, Sherlock looked into Julia's family. She
                        lived with her sister and their stepfather, Doctor Roylott. He was apparently a big name in cosmetics
                        and had even guest starred on Connie Prince's show a few times. Both seemed genuinely devastated
                        by Julia's death. We then met her fiance, Percy Armitage. He was a strange bloke. Very beardy. He
                        also, we discovered, kept snakes. None of the zoos were missing any reptiles so it appeared to be
                        that one of Percy's had bitten Julia. He denied it, saying that Julia hated the snakes so wouldn't
                        go near them. The case went on for a few days but we didn't seem to be getting anywhere. Sherlock
                        was convinced that Julia had been murdered in some way. He didn't believe that a snake could get
                        into someone's bedroom, kill them in their sleep and then leave without being spotted by anyone else.
                        Percy had an alibi for the night Julia was killed and he kept his snakes at his own flat. It seemed
                        obvious that he was involved but wherever we turned, we hit a brick wall. And to make matters worse,
                        Helen was starting to complain that she too was feeling tired and run down. Was it just grief over
                        her sister's death? Or was something else happening? Sherlock, then, had an idea. He decided to relive
                        Julia's last night. He wanted to spend a night in her bedroom and he wanted me to join him. Yes.
                        You can all stop sniggering. I was going to sleep on the floor. We went into the bedroom and Sherlock
                        started to relive Julia's last moments - with guidance from Helen. Julia had been out with some mates
                        but hadn't got too drunk. She'd come home and had had a bath. Sherlock looked at the bottle of expensive-looking
                        bubble bath by Julia's bed. The brand was Roylotts - developed by her stepfather's company. Sherlock
                        asked Helen if she used the same brand. She said that it wasn't yet available in the shops. Their
                        stepfather had given it to her sister to try and then, more recently, to her. Sherlock took the bottle
                        to Barts and analysed the contents. It contained a slow-acting poison. Every time the girls had been
                        using it, they'd been slowly killing themselves. Helen told us that her stepfather had promised it
                        had already been tested. It was safe! Sherlock pointed out that this hadn't been an accident (he
                        didn't exactly break this gently to Helen). Her stepfather had killed her sister in cold blood and
                        was now doing the same to her. He'd put the puncture marks in Julia's ankle to deflect attention
                        onto one of Percy's snakes. We rushed back to the house to confront the old man but it was too late
                        - he was already dead. He'd hung himself from the kitchen light-fitting. He hadn't left a note so
                        we don't know why he wanted to kill his step-daughters. Did he remind them of his late wife? Was
                        it about money? Was he just mad? We, and more tragically Helen, will never know.
