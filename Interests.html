                <p>I play violin when I'm thinking.Sometimes I don't talk for days on end,while immersed in music.</p>
                <p>Darwin claims that power of producing music existed among the human race long before the power of was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it.

        <p>The chess-board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe,the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature.The player on the other side is hidden from us.
